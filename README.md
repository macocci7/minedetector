# minedetector

minesweeper-like puzzle game (jQuery)

with autoplay button,

which starts autoplay clicking a random panel.

This was created in 2016 with old version jQuery, as a joke.

There's a bug on the high-score rankig, but I don't care.

I'm going to remake this with Vue.js someday.

You can use this game freely after clone this repository and deploy it on a web server anywhere you like, and can customize it as you like.
